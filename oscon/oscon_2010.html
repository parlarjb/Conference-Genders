Prior to being elected Mayor, Adams served as a Commissioner on the City Council for four years earning a reputation as a &#8220;policy-driven&#8221; advocate for sustainability, public transit, transportation planning, the arts, and gay rights.</p>


	<p>As a City Commissioner, Adams was Commissioner in Charge of Portland’s Office of Transportation and the Bureau of Environmental Services, and council liaison to, among others, the Regional Arts &#38; Culture Council, the Association of Portland Neighborhood Business Districts, and Worksystems, Incorporated. In his role as Mayor, Adams is the lead Council member on Economic Development, Planning and Sustainability, Education, Arts and Culture, and Transportation.</p>


	<p>During his first year as Mayor, Adams has launched a number of initiatives designed to showcase and provide support to Portland’s open source software community.  Notably, Mayor Adams and City Council approved the nation’s first open source and open data resolution, which places open source software on equal footing with commercial software for purposes of City contracts.  Also, Portland recently launched Civic Apps for Greater Portland, which is the nation’s first regional open data and open source app contest.</p>


	<p>Mayor Adams brings renewed focus to developing and implementing plans that will not only keep Portland livable, vibrant, and economically healthy, but will also increase Portland’s status as a national leader. He is proud of Portland’s open source software community, and he wants to do his part to ensure Portland maintains its reputation as an international hub for open source innovation.</p></div>

	<div class="en_speaker_bio"><p>Keith Bergelt is the chief executive officer of Open Invention Network (OIN), the collaborative enterprise that enables innovation in open source and an increasingly vibrant ecosystem around Linux. In this capacity he is directly responsible for enabling, influencing and defending the integrity of the Linux ecosystem.  Central to the achievement of his goals is the acquisition and transfer of patent rights designed to permit members of the Linux ecosystem to operate free of the threat of assertion and litigation from those whose business models are antithetical to innovation and global economic growth in information technology and computing.</p>


	<p>Prior to joining the Open Invention Network, Mr. Bergelt served as president and <span class="caps">CEO</span> of two Hedge Funds – Paradox Capital and <span class="caps">IPI</span> – formed to unlock the considerable asset value of patents, trademarks and copyrights in middle market companies.  Paradox and <span class="caps">IPI</span> were the first Funds of their kind to offer specialty lending products supported exclusively by intellectual property.  Driven by Mr. Bergelt’s creativity and entrepreneurial approach, these funds enabled the emergence of patents, trademarks and copyrights as a viable source of collateral in asset-based loans, forever reshaping the emerging IP Finance landscape.</p>


	<p>During Mr. Bergelt’s stewardship of these IP-based lending activities, he raised more than $300 million dollars and financed portfolio companies of private equity firms including Texas Pacific Group, Kelso &#38; Co., JH Whitney, Weston Presidio, Goode Partners, Palladium Capital and Castanea Partners, among others.</p>


	<p>Previously, Mr. Bergelt served as a senior advisor to the technology investment division at Texas Pacific Group. He also headed business development, intellectual property and licensing for the Kelso &#38; Company portfolio company Cambridge Display Technology in the United Kingdom. Additionally, he established and served as General Manager of the Strategic Intellectual Asset Management business unit at Motorola Corporation and served as Motorola’s director of Technology Strategy.</p>


	<p>Mr. Bergelt was a co-founder of the Intellectual Property Advisory Practice within the Electronics and Telecommunications Industry group at <span class="caps">SRI</span> Consulting in Menlo Park, California.</p>


	<p>Prior to his extensive private sector experience, Mr. Bergelt served for twelve years as a diplomat with postings at the United Nations in NY and the American Embassy in Tokyo, Japan where he was involved in the negotiation of IP rights protection in Asia.</p>


	<p>Mr. Bergelt holds an Artium Baccalaureus degree from Duke University, a Jurist Doctorate degree from Southern Methodist University School of Law and a Masters of Business Administration degree from Theseus Institute in France.  He is a frequent speaker on corporate strategy, finance and intellectual property management.</p></div>

	<p>Dries is the original creator and project lead for the Drupal open source web publishing and collaboration platform. He serves as president of the Drupal Association, a non-profit organization formed to help Drupal flourish. A native of Belgium, Dries holds a PhD in computer science and engineering from Ghent University.</p>


	<p>Originally written as a bulletin board system, Drupal is a free and open source modular framework and content management system (CMS) written in the programming language <span class="caps">PHP</span>. Drupal, like many modern <span class="caps">CMS</span>&#8217;s, allows the system administrator to organize the content, customize the presentation, automate administrative tasks, and manage site visitors and contributors. Although there is a sophisticated programming interface, most tasks can be accomplished with little or no programming. Drupal is sometimes described as a &#8220;web application framework&#8221;, as its capabilities extend from content management to enabling a wide range of services and transactions.</p></div>

He moved on to Ericsson’s Erlang training and consulting arm working on the first release of the <span class="caps">OTP</span> middleware, applying it to turnkey solutions and flagship telecom applications.</p>


	<p>In 1999, soon after Erlang was released as open source, he founded <a href="http://www.erlang-solutions.com">Erlang Solutions</a>. With offices in the UK, Sweden, Poland (and soon the US), they have become the world leaders in Erlang based consulting, contracting, training, systems development and support services. In 2008, they launched the <a href="http://www.erlang-factory.com">Erlang Factory</a> conferences. At Erlang Solutions, Francesco has worked on major Erlang based projects both within and outside Ericsson, and in his current role as Technical Director, is setting the strategy and vision of the company while supervising the technical teams.</p>


	<p>Francesco is active in the Erlang community not only through regularly talks, seminars and tutorials at conferences worldwide, but also through his involvement in international research projects.  He is the co-author of <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596518189">Erlang Programming</a>, a book published by O’Reilly Media in 2009. With whatever time he has left over, he teaches Erlang to graduates and undergraduates at Oxford University and the IT University of Gothenburg.

	<div class="en_speaker_bio"><p>Chris Drake is the founder and <span class="caps">CEO</span> of FireHost where he oversees the growth, direction, and innovation at the company. According to Chris, “It’s not about secure hosting features, industry trends, or what technologies we invest in. It’s about solving our customer’s core problems and empowering them with the feeling of total security when it comes to their website.”</p>


	<p>Prior to founding FireHost, Drake was the founder of and partner in an interactive marketing and web development company, TargetScope, which oversaw hundreds of websites containing critical data, applications and ecommerce. After seeing time and again that clients’ websites were not adequately protected from new hacker threats, viruses and other malicious cybercrimes, Drake began offering hosting services that addressed clients’ security and performance needs. What emerged was FireHost. In 2008, Drake took the company from being a one-off solution that was offered to customers of TargetScope to being a whole new, and fast growth company all on its own. Since the company’s marketing launch in June 2009, FireHost has grown an average of 40 percent each quarter, raised $2 Million in capital, and been recognized as a major player in the web security space.</p>


	<p>Drake’s career as a secure hosting “superhero” didn’t start the way of most in the web hosting world. He started off as a real-life superhero serving as a paratrooper in the storied 82nd Airborne Division of the US Army. While Based in Fr. Bragg, North Carolina, Drake was hand-picked by commanding General Henry Hugh Shelton (later to be become Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) to migrate the 82nd from their Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) to their first private websites. Since email wasn’t standard practice, these websites had to be totally secure so deployed units could communicate with their families. Chris successfully undertook this challenge and enabled troops to enjoy secure communication electronically with their families around the world.</p>


	<p>Drake is sought after speaker and writer on everything related to web development, hosting and security. He is frequently published in major industry news sites such as VentureBeat, Ecommerce Developer, and Ecommerce Times, and speaks at leading industry events and tradeshows on timely web security issues.</p>


	<p>Drake holds a Bachelor of Business Administration from The University of North Texas, where he was also named Marketing Alumni of the Year in 2007. When he’s not working tirelessly to bring secure web hosting to all, Drake enjoys spending time with his wife Katrena, playing Rugby and mentoring other business owners with start-up challenges.</p></div>

Brian leads Google&#8217;s Chicago engineering efforts and also serves as engineering manager for Google Code and internal advisor for Google&#8217;s open source efforts. Prior to joining Google, Brian was a senior software engineer on the version control team at CollabNet, working on Subversion, cvs2svn, and <span class="caps">CVS</span>. He has also worked at Apple Computer as a senior engineer in their professional services division, developing both client and web applications for Apple&#8217;s largest corporate customers.</p>


	<p>Brian has been an active open source contributor for over ten years. After years of writing small open source programs and bugfixes, he became a core Subversion developer in 2000, and then the lead developer of the cvs2svn utility. He was nominated as a member of the Apache Software Foundation in 2002 and spent two years as the <span class="caps">ASF</span>&#8217;s VP of Public Relations. Brian has written numerous articles and given many presentations on a wide variety of subjects from version control to software development, including co-writing &#8220;Version Control with Subversion&#8221; as well as chapters for &#8220;Unix in a Nutshell&#8221; and &#8220;Linux in a Nutshell.&#8221;</p>


	<p>Brian has an A.B. in Classics from Loyola University Chicago with a major in Latin, a minor in Greek, and a concentration in Fine Arts and Ceramics. Despite growing up in New Orleans and working for Silicon Valley companies for most of his career, he decided years ago that Chicago was his home and stubbornly refuses to move to California.</p></div>

	<div class="en_speaker_bio"><p>Alexandra Samuel is the <span class="caps">CEO</span> of Social Signal, a Vancouver-based company that builds online communities for nonprofit, government and business clients. Alex has guided the online strategy for some of the web&#8217;s most ambitious community ecosystems, including Change Everything and NetSquared. This work builds on her years of consulting, research and writing on online community and civic participation by harnessing the latest generation of web tools to the challenge of community engagement.</p>


	<p>In 2004, Alex received her Ph.D. in Political Science from Harvard University. Her dissertation examined the phenomenon of hacktivism &#8211; politically motivated computer hacking &#8211; as a window on how and why people engage in online community action. Alex interviewed more than fifty programmers and activists worldwide, tracking their motivations for participating in projects ranging from circumventing China&#8217;s online censorship scheme to creating a parody of the <span class="caps">WTO</span> web site at http://www.gatt.org.</p>


	<p>Alex has a history of leadership in envisioning the Internet&#8217;s potential as a tool for community-building. She is a member of the advisory board for DotOrganize, a project that has mapped the non-profit sector&#8217;s technology needs. In 2001 she co-founded DO-Consult, the world&#8217;s leading forum for researchers and practitioners in online consultation and public engagement. As the Research Director for Digital 4Sight’s Governance in the Digital Economy, Alexandra created and guided an investigation into the future of government and democracy for a consortium of twenty governments and businesses from around the world. Previously, she researched online social capital for Robert Putnam&#8217;s Bowling Alone, and co-founded one of Canada&#8217;s first online political forums.</p>


	<p>Alex&#8217;s writing on technology issues has appeared in media outlets like the Toronto Star, <span class="caps">CBC</span> Radio, Business 2.0, and the Chronicle of Higher Education. Her work on topics like <span class="caps">RSS</span>, tagging and online engagement is accessible on her blog.</p>


	<p>Alexandra holds a Ph.D. in Political Science from Harvard University and a B.A. in Politics from Oberlin College.</p></div>

<p>When inspiration strikes, I can be found scribbling on my blog at <a href="http://shiflett.org/">shiflett.org</a>, or on Twitter as <a href="http://twitter.com/shiflett">@shiflett</a>. In 2007, I started <a href="http://phpadvent.org/"><span class="caps">PHP</span> Advent</a>, an Advent calendar for the <span class="caps">PHP</span> community.</p>

<p>I have authored and co-authored a few books&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;most notably <em>Essential <span class="caps">PHP</span> Security</em> and <em><span class="caps">HTTP</span> Developer&#8217;s Handbook</em>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and I occasionally write articles for publications like <em>Smashing Magazine</em>, where I also serve on the editorial panel.</p>

<p>My passion for sharing ideas has brought me to a few conferences&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;including <span class="caps">OSCON</span>, Webstock, South by Southwest, and the Future of Web Apps&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and events like Foo Camp, Kiwi Foo Camp, and the Microsoft Web Dev Summit.</p>

<p>When not in front of a computer, I can usually be found playing soccer in Prospect Park or riding my single-speed bicycle around Brooklyn.</p></div>

Oliver Chair for <span class="caps">SETI</span> (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) and is Director of the Center for <span class="caps">SETI</span> Research at the <span class="caps">SETI</span> Institute in Mountain View, California.  Tarter received her Bachelor of Engineering Physics Degree with Distinction from Cornell University and her Master’s Degree and a Ph.D. in Astronomy from the University of California, Berkeley.  She served as Project Scientist for <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s <span class="caps">SETI</span> program, the High Resolution Microwave Survey, and has conducted numerous observational programs at radio observatories worldwide.  Since the termination of funding for <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s <span class="caps">SETI</span> program in 1993, she has served in a leadership role to secure private funding to continue this exploratory science.  Currently, she serves on the management board for the Allen Telescope Array, a joint project between the <span class="caps">SETI</span> Institute and the UC Berkeley Radio Astronomy Laboratory.  When this innovative array of 350 6-m antennas begins operations at the UC’s Hat Creek Radio Observatory, it will simultaneously survey the radio universe for known and unexpected sources of astrophysical emissions, and speed up the search for radio emissions from other distant technologies by orders of magnitude.</p>


	<p>Tarter’s work has brought her wide recognition in the scientific community, including the Lifetime Achievement Award from Women in Aerospace, two Public Service Medals from <span class="caps">NASA</span>, Chabot Observatory’s Person of the Year award (1997), Women of Achievement Award in the Science and Technology category by the Women’s Fund and the San Jose Mercury News (1998), and the Tesla Award of Technology at the Telluride Tech Festival (2001).  She was elected an <span class="caps">AAAS</span> Fellow in 2002 and a California Academy of Sciences Fellow in 2003 (and <span class="caps">CAS</span> Scientific Trustee in 2007).  In 2004 Time Magazine named her one of the Time 100 most influential people in the world, and in 2005 Tarter was awarded the Carl Sagan Prize for Science Popularization at Wonderfest, the biannual San Francisco Bay Area Festival of Science.  In 2006 Tarter became a National Advisory Board member for the Center for Inquiry’s Office of Public Policy in Washington, DC.  She is also a Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) Fellow.  Tarter was one of three Technology, Education, Design (TED) prize winners in 2009.</p>


	<p>Tarter is deeply involved in the education of future citizens and scientists.  In addition to her scientific leadership at <span class="caps">NASA</span> and <span class="caps">SETI</span> Institute, Tarter has been the Principal Investigator for two curriculum development projects funded by <span class="caps">NSF</span>, NASA, and others.  The first, the Life in the Universe series, created 6 science teaching guides for grades 3-9 (published 1994-96).  Her second project, Voyages Through Time, is an integrated high school science curriculum on the fundamental theme of evolution in six modules:  Cosmic Evolution, Planetary Evolution, Origin of Life, Evolution of Life, Hominid Evolution and Evolution of Technology (published 2003).  Tarter is a frequent speaker for science teacher meetings and at museums and science centers, bringing her commitment to science and education to both teachers and the public.  Many people are now familiar with her work as portrayed by Jodie Foster in the movie Contact.</p></div>

	<p>As a core developer of <span class="caps">PHP</span> and a member of the <span class="caps">PHP</span> Group, I help curate development of the world’s most popular (and open source) web development language. Along the way, I started <span class="caps">PHP</span>-GTK, helped create Smarty, co-wrote <span class="caps">PHP</span> Developer’s Cookbook, and have been serving as the architect of the Unicode and internationalization support in <span class="caps">PHP 6</span>.</p>


	<p>I’m a regular speaker at leading conferences like <span class="caps">OSCON</span>, as well as <span class="caps">PHP</span> events worldwide. To keep a healthy mix with my technical work, I’m training for the Paris marathon in 2010, which should offset my dedication to fine food. I love good beer, brew some of my own, and if you ever want to try a craft beer yourself, I can heartily recommend North Coast Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout.</p></div>
